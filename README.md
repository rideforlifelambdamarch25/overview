> Welcome to Ride For Life, the app helping provide motorcycle ambulances to get to pregnant mothers in labor when they are hours away from the nearest help by foot

## Summary

> Have a chance to work with a real client!

SAFE serves mothers in Uganda to improve maternal and child survival. One of the biggest obstacles women face while pregnant is getting to a health facility to safely deliver. Most people do not own a car or a motorcycle, and a majority live greater than 5 km from a health center (an hour by foot). Can you imagine trying to walk an hour on foot when you were pregnant, and in labor? SAFE provides motorcycle ambulances to improve this problem, but mothers have a hard time contacting them in time. This app identifies and sends a text to the nearest motorcycle ambulance driver.
